# deagleLogs

This was my first ever Lua addon and at one point was in the top 5 addons on both coderhire and scriptfodder.

The code isn't great as even the recode was done when I was very inexperienced (Jan-Feb 2014) with the original version being made early 2013.

I wouldn't use this as example code for learning as it's pretty bad and I didn't really know proper programming practices when I made it.
