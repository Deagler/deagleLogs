# deagleLogs

This was my first ever Lua addon and at one point was in the top 5 addons on both coderhire and scriptfodder(While being used by over 500 servers and over 25,000 players)


## Timeline
- *Early 2013* - deagleLogs v1
- *Early 2014* - deagleLogs v2 (Total recode from the ground up including UI/UX)
- *Mid 2016* - I make the source code public

### *This code hasn't been updated since 2014 while Garry's Mod definetly has. Some code may not work anymore*
